          <h1>Brief history of JS(ES5,ES6+ and ESNEXT)</h1>

          <p>
            JavaScript is a programming language that was created in 1995 by
            Netscape Communications Corporation. It was initially designed to
            enable simple client-side scripts in web browsers, allowing web
            pages to be more interactive.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 1997, JavaScript was standardized by the European Computer
            Manufacturers Association (ECMA) as ECMAScript. The first version,
            ECMAScript 1, was based on JavaScript and was released in 1997.
          </p>

          <p>
            ECMAScript 5 (ES5) was released in 2009 and is the version of
            JavaScript that is supported by most modern web browsers. It added
            features such as strict mode, which helps to improve the security
            and reliability of JavaScript code, and support for JSON (JavaScript
            Object Notation), a popular data interchange format.
          </p>

          <p>
            ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015, was released in
            2015 and added many new features to JavaScript, including classes,
            modules, and arrow functions.
          </p>

          <p>
            ECMAScript 2016 (ES7) was released in 2016 and added support for the
            Array.prototype.includes() method, which determines whether an array
            includes a certain element.
          </p>

          <p>
            ECMAScript 2017 (ES8) was released in 2017 and added the
            Object.values() and Object.entries() methods, which return the
            values and key-value pairs, respectively, of an object's own
            enumerable properties.
          </p>

          <p>
            ECMAScript 2018 (ES9) was released in 2018 and added the async and
            await keywords, which allow developers to write asynchronous code in
            a synchronous-like style.
          </p>

          <p>
            ECMAScript 2019 (ES10) was released in 2019 and added features such
            as the Array.flat() and Array.flatMap() methods, which can be used
            to flatten arrays, and the String.trimStart() and String.trimEnd()
            methods, which can be used to remove whitespace from the beginning
            and end of strings, respectively.
          </p>
            
          <p></p>
            ECMAScript 2020 (ES11) was
            released in 2020 and added features such as the Promise.allSettled()
            method, which allows developers to work with promises that may not
            resolve or reject, and the globalThis variable, which provides a
            consistent way to reference the global object in JavaScript.

            </p>

            <p> 
            ECMAScript 2021 (ES12) was released in 2021 and added features such
            as the String.prototype.matchAll() method, which allows developers
            to iterate over all matches of a regular expression in a string, and
            the Promise.any() method, which returns a promise that resolves or
            rejects with the first fulfilled or rejected promise in an iterable
            of promises.
          </p>

<p>ECMAScript 2022 (ES13) is currently in development and is expected to be released in 2022. It is expected to include features such as the String.prototype.replaceAll() method, which allows developers to replace all occurrences of a string or regular expression with a replacement string, and the Number.prototype.isNaN() method, which determines whether a value is NaN (Not-a-Number).

</p>

<p>ECMAScript "next", or ES.Next, refers to the version of ECMAScript that is currently in development and is expected to be released after the current version (ES13). It is not yet known what features will be included in this version.</p>
